# cubies

This is the code for the paper "Automated Pursuit of God-like Folk Algorithms for Rubik's Cube".  The figures in that paper can be generated by running the following scripts:

- `example_alg.py` for the illustration of the algorithm
- `approximate_construction_mini.py` for the RCONS figures
- `fork_the_best_mini.py` for the multi-objective optimization figures

In both cases, the `do_cons` and `show_results` variables near the `# config` comment should be set to `True`.
